-At the very beggining of the presentation you should present a slide on which you introduce the background of your project. 
-Also ad there why we are studying this: immature orangutans have to acquire many foraging skills (they have to learn how to recognize and process around 205 food items). 
-We also know that they learn them over many years and through observational social learning from the mother. 
What we don't know yet is the mothers side of the story: according to Trivers theory, mothers should invest in their offspring, so that they develop fast. 
So, we expect that orangutans mothers support their offsprings diet learning. 
-But so far we have no evidence for teaching. 
With your thesis you will look at whether the mother is involved on a more subtle level, namely whether she adjusts her level of tolerance during beging behavior. 
-Also mention that aside from peering, begging is a means through which immature orangutans learn about food items (check out the jaeggi references).
